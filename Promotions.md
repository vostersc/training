## This document defines my view of Sr, Mid, Jr.
For promotions in general you want to be already performing at the level you are seeking. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck... Additionally I have to advocate for your promotion and not loose credibility.

### Jr.
I don't typically hire JRs.

### Mid.
**Independent -** This doesn't mean you never ask for help. In some ways asking for clarification is one of the things that separates Srs from other devs. They know what to clarify at the start of the task. It more means that once the task is clearly defined you need very little technical assistance. There will still be back and forth discussions about the best way to do things but a mid level always has at least one decent solution that they could implement. Additionally it means fewer kickbacks/bugs. It means fewer major architectural mishaps that leads have to come along and rewrite or fix or modify.

**Proactive and Communicative -** They are starting to show signs of leadership. For example they are beginning to lead QA in discussions on how to test their tasks instead of being reactive to QA asking for things. They contribute in meetings, especially in their area of expertise. They point out possible issues to avoid in tasks. They are beginning to contribute to architectural conversations, meaning they catch issues and ask questions that show they understand what is going on in the app. For me, this one is less about being right all the time and more about whether you put in the effort to be proactive. It is way easier to guide someone when they are proactively doing the wrong thing rather than waiting around for help and never being wrong.

**Productive -** Completes enough tasks. Get in the general zone of mid level points.

### Sr.
Coming soon...
