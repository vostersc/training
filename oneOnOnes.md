## Why 1:1s?
My primary goal is to ensure that you are happy with your postition, and that the company is happy with you. I'll share what the company needs most. Listening carefully gives you an opportunity to understand how promotions happen. I'll also share where you stand from a performance standpoint. I try to include a mini performance review in most 1:1s so you aren't caught off guard at the end of the quarter.

I'll try to share my own goals and problems. I hope you'll reciprocate. In my experience, the best one-on-ones are problem solving sessions where we put our heads together and try to make something just a little bit better. However, you can't have a good problem solving session if one side is too afraid to be vulnerable because it might damage their image. Know that you don't have to be perfect to get promoted here.

## 1:1 Agenda
Typically I hold one on ones at the beginning of each sprint.

## Suggestions

### Potential 1:1 discussion topics:
- Follow up on past 1:1s, problems, and goals. How are you progressing with the feedback you've received?
- What problems or sub optimal situations can we fix/eliminate/minimize?
- Career goals and direction. Are your tasks moving you in the right direction? Are you excited about any future projects or initiatives?
- Feedback and difficulties. Where do you see room for improvement on a team, codebase, or personal level? What's one thing you'd like to change?
- Codebase questions and learning. Are there areas of the codebase we should discuss to help you feel more comfortable?
- Outside work life. What do you enjoy? Are there any external challenges blocking your career goals? Are you feeling balanced or burnt out?
  
### Example questions to ask:
- I want to work on X skill. What should I do?
- I want Y promotion. What stands in the way? How is the team/how am I perceived?
- I think A, B, C. What direction is the company headed in regards to those topics?
