## Why 1:1s?
**One-on-ones are your time**. From a management perspective, my primary goal is to ensure that you are satisfied working here.
This means I'd like to know if you enjoy your tasks. I'd like to know if you feel comfortable contributing and affecting change.
It also means exploring ways we can improve the status quo so everyone can better achieve their goals.

In my experience, the best one-on-ones are problem solving sessions where we discuss what I can do to help you achive a career goal.
However, I've carved this time out of my schedule so you can discuss what you feel is important. **I'm a passenger here. You are the driver!**

## Potential 1:1 discussion topics:
- Follow up on past 1:1s, problems, and goals. How are you progressing with the feedback you've received?
- What problems or sub optimal situations can we fix/eliminate/minimize?
- Career goals and direction. Are your tasks moving you in the right direction? Are you excited about any future projects or initiatives?
- Feedback and difficulties. Where do you see room for improvement on a team, codebase, or personal level? What's one thing you'd like to change?
- Codebase questions and learning. Are there areas of the codebase we should discuss to help you feel more comfortable?
- Outside work life. What do you enjoy? Are there any external challenges blocking your career goals? Are you feeling balanced or burnt out?
  
## Example questions you can ask:
- I want to work on X skill. What should I do?
- I want Y promotion. What stands in the way?
- I think A, B, C. What direction is the company headed in regards to those topics?
