# A Guide on How to Assign Points
Note: scoping varies from team to team. These points probably won't map to yours. This is simply a starting guide. Much of scoping is situational.
## Relevant
1. Quantity of code can imply increased task complexity.
2. How much research it took.
3. How much coordination it took between people, systems, departments.
4. How spread across applications your code changes were.
5. Actions or changes that increase technical difficulty are relevant.
## Not Relevant
1. How long it took you. Your experience level doesn't affect task complexity. You rate based on the "reasonably experienced engineeer."
2. Blockers are probably not relevant. You should switch to other tasks if you are regularly blocked while working on this task.
