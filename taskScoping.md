# A Guide on How to Assign Points
Note: scoping varies from team to team. These points probably won't map to yours. This is simply a starting guide. Much of scoping is situational and some teams purposefully don't even define points.
Ratings don't equal points. Ratings are 1 - 5. Points are derived from ratings meaning giving a task a 3 would give the task 5 points. Giving a task a 5 means giving the task 13 points. Points increase exponentially with ratings because larger tasks are more difficult to scope correctly. By exponentially increasing the number of points rewarded you give more leway for unforseen events.
## Relevant
1. Quantity of code can imply increased task complexity.
2. How much research it took.
3. How much coordination it took between people, systems, departments.
4. How spread across applications your code changes were.
5. Actions or changes that increase technical difficulty are relevant.
## Not Relevant
1. How long it took you. Your experience level doesn't affect task complexity. You rate based on the "reasonably experienced engineeer."
2. Blockers are probably not relevant. You should switch to other tasks if you are regularly blocked while working on this task.
## Example
- .5 (.5? pts) - A very quick fix. Takes more time to test, PR, merge than to fix.
- 1 (1 pts) - A quick fix or research.
- 2 (2 pts) - A typical bug.
- 3 (5 pts) - Refactor or feature.
- 4 (8 pts) - Large refactor or large feature.
- 5 (13 pts) - You shouldn't get a rating this high. The task likely needs to be broken down. Typically only retroactivly scored.
