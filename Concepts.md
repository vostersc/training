### The Anti-Motivation Motivational Message
Don’t focus on motivation. Motivation is like a sensitive test. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, and sometimes it depends on your QA environment.

A ways back I stopped trying to squash the "I'm not feeling motivated today" bug. I noticed that even if you eventually achieve a motivated state, the victory is ephemeral, slipping through your fingers like sand the moment something bad happens.

In contrast, I've found that focusing on habits gives me a more stable platform for achieving my goals. Habits work when you are sad. Habits work when you are happy. Habits even work when you didn't remember to run your tests in docker.

If you want to know how to create a powerful habit, consider implementing the principle of Kaizen. To create a habit, kaizen says to ask "what is the most ridiculously small step I can take towards my goal," and then just do that

### How to Avoid Finger Pointing in Retrospectives
How do you have a Retro/Meeting where you discuss issues while avoiding finger pointing? 

Avoid finger pointing by focusing on sociological questions, topics, not psychological ones. E.g. "how can we reduce the likelihood that this mistake happens"? Sociological problems focus on fixing processes, cultures, and environments, not the individuals that operate therin.

In contrast, psychological questions dig into individual issues. They typically do not belong in public meetings. Psychological questions often become accusatory in public meetings. E.g. "why did you do X and not Y?"
