## This document defines my view of Sr, Mid, Jr. in terms of Performance (In Progress)
For promotions you should be performing at the level you are seeking. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck... Additionally I have to advocate for your promotion and not be afraid of losing credibility.

## Performance Categories
1. Dilligence - Do you work hard? Do you care about quality? Are your proactive?
2. Teamwork - Do you proactively communicate? Do you participate and pitch in?
3. Judgement - Can I trust what you tell me?
4. Skill - How good are you at your core job?

#### Rating Definitions 1 - 4
1. You are making serious mistakes. Please rectify your behavior, quickly.
2. You are performing as expected for a mid level.
3. You are performing as expected for a senior/team lead.
4. You are doing extremely well. I'll likely use you as an example to the department.

## Roles

### Junior (SWE I)
I don't typically hire JRs.

### Mid Level (SWE II)
Mid level engineers are primiarliy defined by their independence. They are capable of finding and fixing many issues in the application with out direct help. There will be a few complex areas of the application where they are not ready to work independently.

**Independent -**
This doesn't mean you never ask for help. In some ways asking for clarification is one of the things that separates good from bad devs. They know what to clarify at the start of the task. It more means that once the task is clearly defined you need very little technical assistance. There will still be back and forth discussions about the best way to do things but a mid level always has at least one decent solution that they could implement. Additionally it means fewer kickbacks/bugs. It means fewer major architectural mishaps that leads have to come along and rewrite or fix or modify.

**Proactive and Communicative -**
They are starting to show signs of leadership. For example they are beginning to lead QA in discussions on how to test their tasks instead of being reactive to QA asking for things. They contribute in meetings, especially in their area of expertise. They point out possible issues to avoid in tasks. They are beginning to contribute to architectural conversations, meaning they catch issues and ask questions that show they understand what is going on in the app. For me, this one is less about being right all the time and more about whether you put in the effort to be proactive. It is way easier to guide someone when they are proactively doing the wrong thing rather than waiting around for help and never being wrong.

**Productive -**
Completes enough tasks. Get in the general zone of mid level points.

### Senior
Sr's are defined by their ability to independently and reliably design and deliver solutions in an area of expertise, spotting potential issues and accounting for them.

**Expertise and Architecture -**
They need to come to the table with architectural suggestions and critiques, especially in their focus area. They must be able to spot bad ideas, managing up and down to get the right solution. Sr's need to feel comfortable across all areas of the application. This doesn't mean that a frontend Sr knows exactly what a deploy process is, but they should be conceptually familiar with what happens. They also need a strong area of expertise. Typically this means they focus on front end, back end, databases, or deployment. This means the leadership team can count on them to resolve issues in that area, alerting management of possible future problems. I shouldn't have to worrry or hand hold any solution. That doesn't mean architects and managers aren't involved in your decisions, but it does mean this individual could drive a solution to the finish line with out management's input. You should have experience breaking out a project.

**Proactive and Communicative -**
They need to be capable of pushing back techically on PRs and in meetings. This can involve dealing with non technical people. You may not spend time interacting with customers or external people, but I shouldn't worry about placing you in front of someone non technical. You should know not to say certain things. This means you don't blurt out unreasonable deadlines or promise things when discussions need to happen first. You know to leave ambeguity and space for problems to happen when communicating in genaral. You can explain what is happening at different levels. For example you can tell a Jr, a Sr, a Manager, and a customer how something works, adjusting your explanation to each.

**Productive -**
Completes enough tasks. Get in the general zone of Sr. level points. However, typically at this level we care more about quality and having fewer kick backs.
